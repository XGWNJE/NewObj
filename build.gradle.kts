// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
// We are using the plugins block in the app-level build.gradle.kts for androidApplication and kotlinAndroid.
// This file can be kept very minimal.

// If you need to define plugin aliases here from the catalog, you can:
// plugins {
//   alias(libs.plugins.androidApplication) apply false
//   alias(libs.plugins.jetbrainsKotlinAndroid) apply false
// }

// It's also common to see this file completely empty if all plugin applications
// are handled within the respective module's build.gradle.kts file.
// For a single-module project, this is often the case.

// Ensure you have cleaned up any old 'buildscript' or 'allprojects' blocks
// if you are migrating from an older Gradle setup.
